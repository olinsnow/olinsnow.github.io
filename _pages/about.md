### Our Team

Olin Clean Snowmobile is a team of undergraduate students from Olin College of Engineering with the primary goal of acquiring technical skills through the modification of a snowmobile. The aim of the team is to alter the snowmobile to have low emissions and low noise polluton, learning how to apply engineering skills in a way that impacts the world in a positive way. This snowmobile will serve as a platform for team members to dive into mechanical, electrical, and software engineering fields that take sustainability into account. Olin Clean Snowmobile is actively pursuing a culture of learning and mentorship, creating a space for the transfer of knowledge and ideas.

### SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge
The SAE International Clean Snowmobile Challenge is a competition for designing and implementing modifications to a snowmobile to reduce emissions and noise. Undergraduate and graduate engineers from schools across the world apply their knowledge and experience toward one goal: making an existing snowmobile clean. The Olin Clean Snowmobile team will be competing in the diesel category by converting an existing snowmobile to diesel fuel, then reducing emissions and noise. Aside from the snowmobile being clean, the team will compete in events such as acceleration, handling, and design.
