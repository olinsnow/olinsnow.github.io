### Team Mission
The goal of the Olin Clean Snowmobile team is to reduce emissions and noise and increase performance in a production snowmobile. We will ultimately compete with other teams participating in the SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge. Team members will learn valuable skills regarding mechanical and electrical engineering, sustainability, and business.

### Members
Team membership is open to any current Olin College student. Our members have a wide range of backgrounds and enter with a variety of skills. We are actively recruiting new members, and we would love for you to join us!
